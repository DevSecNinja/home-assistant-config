    \ - **Trigger Options:**\n\n    Activate lights, switches, scenes, and scripts
    when the automation is triggered.\n\n    - **Entity State:**\n      - Turn lights
    ON when an entity changes from OFF to ON.\n      - Turn lights OFF when an entity
    changes from ON to OFF.\n\n    - **Sun Elevation:**\n      - Turn lights ON when
    the sun's elevation falls below a set value.\n      - Turn lights OFF when the
    sun's elevation rises above a set value. \n\n    - **Ambient Light:**\n      -
    Turn lights ON when ambient light falls below a set LUX value.\n      - Turn lights
    OFF when ambient light rises above a set LUX value. \n\n    - **Time-Based Option:**\n
    \     - Define start and end times to turn lights ON and OFF.\n\n  - **Light Control
    Options:**\n      - Utilize \"Light Control\" to adjust brightness, colour temperature,
    colour, and transition times.\n\n  - **Dynamic Lighting Options:**\n    - Opt
    for 'Dynamic Lighting' to continuously adjust brightness based on lux values or
    adapt colour temperature and brightness according to the sun's changing elevation.\n\n
    \ - **Night Lights Mode:**\n    - Enable 'Night Lights' for softer illumination
    during night time activities, automatically enabled based on conditions.\n\n  -
    **Manual Override:**\n    - Use \"Bypass Options\" for manual bypassing of trigger
    sensors, providing manual control and additional customization.\n\n  - **Weekdays
    Condition Option:**\n    - Specify the weekday selections to define when the automation
    can run.\n</details>\n\nNeed help?\n- FAQ: [Click Here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/527354/2)\n-

            colour temperature and brightness based on the sun''s changing elevation.
            Choose from nine preset options available in the dropdown menu.


            1 - Lux Controlled Brightness

            2 - Lux Controlled Brightness Inverted

            3 - Sun Elevation Lighting - Colour Temp

            4 - Sun Elevation Lighting - Brightness

            5 - Sun Elevation Lighting - Brightness Inverted

            6 - Sun Elevation Lighting - Colour Temp + Brightness

            7 - Sun Elevation Lighting - Colour Temp + Brightness Inverted

            8 - Sun Elevation Lighting - Colour Temp + Lux Controlled Brightness

            9 - Sun Elevation Lighting - Colour Temp + Lux Controlled Brightness Inverted


            A numbering system has been implemented to facilitate navigation within
            the dropdown selections. Each number corresponds to a specific configuration,
            aiding users in identifying and adjusting the settings used within each
            selection. For instance, when selecting "3 - Sun Elevation Lighting -
            Colour Temp" as a dropdown option, settings marked "Used in options 3,
            6, 7, 8 or 9" are required for that respective selection because number
            3 is included in those options.
