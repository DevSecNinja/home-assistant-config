    \ - **Trigger Options:**\n\n    Activate lights, switches, scenes, and scripts
    when the automation is triggered.\n\n    - **Entity State:**\n      - Turn lights
    ON when an entity changes from OFF to ON.\n      - Turn lights OFF when an entity
    changes from ON to OFF.\n\n    - **Press Button:**\n      - Turn lights ON when
    you press a button.\n      - Turn lights OFF when you press a button.\n\n    -
    **Sun Elevation:**\n      - Turn lights ON when the sun's elevation falls below
    a set value.\n      - Turn lights OFF when the sun's elevation rises above a set
    value.\n\n    - **Ambient Light:**\n      - Turn lights ON when ambient light
    falls below a set LUX value.\n      - Turn lights OFF when ambient light rises
    above a set LUX value.\n\n    - **Time-Based Option:**\n      - Define start and
    end times to turn lights ON and OFF.\n\n  - **Light Control Options:**\n      -
    Utilize \"Light Control\" to adjust brightness, colour temperature, colour, and
    transition times.\n\n  - **Dynamic Lighting Options:**\n    - Opt for 'Dynamic
    Lighting' to automatically adjust brightness based on lux values, and/or adjust
    brightness and colour temperature according to the sun's position or the time
    of day.\n    - Opt to use the 'State Control Option,' allowing you to toggle between
    dynamic lighting and normal lighting based on the entity's activation state.\n\n
    \ - **Night Lights Mode:**\n    - Enable 'Night Lights' for softer illumination
    during night time activities, automatically enabled based on conditions.\n\n  -
    **Manual Override:**\n    - Use \"Bypass Options\" for manual bypassing of trigger
    sensors, providing manual control and additional customization.\n\n  - **Weekdays
    Condition Option:**\n    - Specify the weekday selections to define when the automation
    can run.\n</details>\n\nNeed help?\n- FAQ: [Click Here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/527354/2)\n-

            A numbering system has been implemented to facilitate navigation within
            the dropdown selections. Each number corresponds to a specific configuration,
            aiding users in identifying and adjusting the settings used within each
            selection. For instance, when selecting "3 - Sun Elevation Lighting -
            Colour Temp" as a dropdown option, settings marked "Used in options 3,
            6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 13" are required for that respective selection because
            number 3 is included in those options.

            or brightness based on your selected Dynamic Lighting option.


            **Note** - When using a **Time Controlled** option (10, 11, 12, or 13),
            the minimum heartbeat should be set to no lower than 1 minute, with adjustments
            made in 1-minute increments (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on), as setting
            it lower will not provide any benefit and may slow down your system''s

            of the light transition, adjusting this value will determine the size

            to the eye. Take the time to determine the correct heartbeat value for
            your needs. The heartbeat is only active between the start and end points.
