    \ - **Appliance Trigger:**\n      - Enter the power sensor entity that measures
    the live current draw of the appliance. Common devices with these sensors include
    smart plugs, energy meters, etc.\n      - The automation is triggered when the
    appliance's current draw exceeds a set wattage.\n      - The automation ends when
    the appliance's current draw falls below a set value.\n\n  - **Notification Options:**\n
    \     - Send notification messages to one or multiple devices when the appliance
    starts, finishes or the watchdog is triggered.\n      - Your end message can also
    include estimates of total power consumption and cost.\n      - Include duration
    tracking in your end message to track the appliance's operational time for the
    task or cycle.\n      - Opt to sends a repeated notifications to remind you when
    the appliance cycle is complete.\n      - Notifications are compatible with both
    Apple iOS and Android devices, ensuring universal accessibility.\n\n  - **Power
    Tracking:**\n      - Utilize power tracking for estimating total power consumption
    and cost. \n      \n      ⚠️ **Disclaimer** - These values are estimates and should
    only be used as a guide. Please avoid relying solely on these estimates for accuracy
    and use them at your own risk. We cannot be held responsible for any inaccuracies
    or resulting losses, damages, inconvenience, or anything else that may occur.\n\n
    \ - **Duration Tracking:**\n      - You can include duration tracking in your
    end message to monitor the appliance's operational time for each task or cycle.\n\n
    \ - **Watchdog:**\n      - The watchdog option monitors an appliance cycle completion.\n
    \     - It sends a notification if a cycle completion fails within the specified
    time frame.\n\n  - **Custom Actions:**\n      - Tailor custom actions to suit
    your preferences and needs, enhancing the automation's functionality.\n      -
    Configure actions such as triggering announcements on platforms like The Voice
    (HA), Google, Alexa, etc., to keep you informed about appliance events.\n\n  -
    **Time-Based Automation:**\n      - Specify precise start and end times along
    with weekday selections to define when the automation can run.\n\n  - **Custom
    Conditions:**\n      - Enter any custom conditions to further customize the automation
    process.\n</details>\n\nNeed help? \n- FAQ: [Click Here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/650166/2)\n-
