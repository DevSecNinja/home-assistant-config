            You can choose from ten options available in the dropdown menu. If your

            A numbering system has been implemented to facilitate navigation within
            the dropdown selections. Each number corresponds to a specific configuration,
            aiding users in identifying and adjusting the settings used within each
            selection. For instance, when selecting "8 - Numeric State - Above" as
            a dropdown option, settings marked "Used in options 8, 9 or 10" are required
            for that respective selection because number 8 is included in those options.
