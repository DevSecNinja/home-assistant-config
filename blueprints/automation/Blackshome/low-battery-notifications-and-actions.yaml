    \ - **Trigger Options:**\n    - **Button Helper:** Press a button in the user
    interface (UI) to check battery levels.\n    - **Time & Day:** Automatically periodically
    checks battery levels on any given time and day.\n\n  - **Battery Sensors:**\n
    \   - Automatically detects all battery sensors used in Home Assistant.\n    -
    Choose one or more battery sensor fields to include in notifications — e.g., Friendly
    Name, Floor, Area, Device, or Entity ID.\n    - Set a battery low warning percentage
    to identify all batteries below this level.\n    - Detects Low, unavailable &
    unknown batteries.\n    - Excludes specific battery sensors from notifications.\n
    \   - Create a custom group of battery sensors with its own independent low battery
    warning percentage.\n\n  - **Notification Options:**\n    - Opt to send messages
    to one or multiple devices.\n    - Opt to display your notifications directly
    within the Home Assistant user interface (UI).\n    - Opt to display your low
    battery alerts and status on a dashboard.\n    - Choose which battery sensors
    to use, and then select their states from one of three preset messages:\n        -
    Battery Low % Level + Low Battery Level + Unavailable + Unknown.\n        - Battery
    Low % Level & Low Battery Level.\n        - Unavailable or Unknown Sensors.\n
    \   - Opt to receive a confirmation message if all batteries are okay.\n    -
    Opt to use action buttons in your device notification that allows you to add your
    low batteries to a To-Do list.\n    - Compatible with Apple iOS and Android devices.\n\n
    \ - **Custom Actions:**\n    - Customize actions to suit your preferences and
    needs, enhancing the automations functionality.\n    - Utilize 10 custom predetermined
    battery templates within the blueprint for more tailored and precise actions.\n
    \   - Configure custom actions to include features like customizing notifications
    or playing announcements on platforms like The Voice (HA), Google, Alexa, TTS,
    etc.\n\n  - **Custom Conditions:**\n    - Enter any custom conditions to further
    customize the automation process.\n</details>\n\nNeed help? \n- FAQ: [Click Here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/653754/2?u=blacky)\n-

            **Sticky Notification** ensure that important alerts are not dismissed
            when selected. They remain on your notification screen until you actively

            until addressed.


            **Notification Channel** allow you to easily organize different notification
            settings, including notification sounds, vibrations, and other device-specific
            features. If you choose this option, please enter your desired channel
            name below.


            **Icon** allows you to replace the default Home Assistant icon with one
            of your choice. If selected, choose your preferred icon using the **Icon
            - Android Only** option below, and set the icon colour using **Icon Colour
            - Android Only**.
