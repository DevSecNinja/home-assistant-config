    # esp-idf is needed to have a better performance on Bluetooth Proxy vs Arduino
    # Unfortunately, the Zehnder module seems to work not as reliable on esp-idf as with arduino
    # When I run a 10m timer, it sometimes work and sometimes doesn't while with Arduino this is much more stable
    # type: esp-idf
